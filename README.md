# E-Commerce-React-Hooks

Just transformed the other application (E-Commerce-React-Class-Component) into a Function Component (React Hooks).

This is a Function Component application built with Redux and Saga. The API was created in a simple way because the focus in this application was work with Redux, Saga using the Function Component only.

Start the application with:
npm install,
yarn start,
json-server server.json -p 3333
